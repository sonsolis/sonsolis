This project came about from me looking for a way to publish all my work under a single domain.

Through this project I've been teaching myself web development. Its still has a long way to go as I learn more about the different tools and frameworks within web development.

It has also come a long way when giving me a space to publish and quickly reference the things I've done as I've developed as a computer scientist.
